Tools to work with Luftdaten data in R

This is the beginning of a package to make the [luftdaten archive data](http://archive.luftdaten.info) more accesible in R (RStudio). What it does at the moment is list and download all of the data in parquet format. There is much to be done!

Install using `devtools::install_github("bobturneruk/airdata")`.

Check out the [vignette on downloading](vignettes/download_files.Rmd) and the [vignette on querying with spark](vignettes/query_parquet_files.Rmd).
